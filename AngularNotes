2)
npm install @angular/cli -g

3)
ng new TaskManagerTestApp --style=scss --skip-install
       <application name>   

It will create the folder structure in your current directory

4)
npm install

This command will install essential package which are required for run 
angular application.
List of package are specified in package.json and internally it will 
read the list of dependency in package.json file and install them.

a).
ng serve --open --port=5200 
this commonad will compile and start executing the angular aplication.
By Default port of angular is 4200 in case If you want to change the 
port number you can use --port=5200

Internally it used nodejs to run the applicaiton.

b).
ng serve --open
http://locahost:4200


<b>Basic Concepts:</b>
Code compilation process in Angular:

1)
Applicaiton source code is written in Type Script.
The code written in Type script are well structed and easier to understand 
and to maintainable in large scale application.

Type script code cannot be excuted directly by browser because browser understand 
java script only. To over come this type script must converted into 
java script.
For doing this compiler (called tsc) is used to conver it into java-script code.

2)
Template(HTML): 
Design logic is written in html. Instead of running the html login in directly 
in browser, The angular compiler(called ngc) first converts the html logic into java-script code.
And then browser execute the java-script code to generate the
dom element. Thus the output appears in browser.
The dom element can be dynamically manipulated by scripts and based on the changes to the applicaiton data.

For example if the price of the product changing proramg same will be auto matically reflected in text box on the page.
